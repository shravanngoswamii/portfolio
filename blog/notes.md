1. MCMC/ThermodynamicIntegration docs main link is broken, I guess it's author have not renewed the domain and github is still redirecting to custom domain, just need a minor github pages setting or else domain renewal.
link â€” https://theogf.github.io/ThermodynamicIntegration.jl/

Other Issues I found:
1. Broken Link - [MCMC/EllipticalSliceSampling.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/EllipticalSliceSampling.jl/blob/d8e58035bac96eca140554cee6e2685d9f90a748/docs/src/index.md?plain=1#L21C46-L21C104)
